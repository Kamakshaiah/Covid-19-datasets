Given the COVID-19 vaccination capacity limitations, an urgent question was raised regarding whether it would be better to (i) complete double-dose COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare personnel and older adults before beginning double-dose vaccination of younger adults (double-dose strategy) or (ii) allocate a single dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all adults regardless of age before administering the second dose (single-dose-first strategy). We used an age-structured susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) compartment model to compare the effectiveness of possible COVID-19 vaccination strategies and the length of public health and social measures (PHSM) to minimize the cumulative COVID-19 disease risk and death toll. Our results indicate that if the single-dose-first strategy was taken, an estimated total of 1,387,078 persons, i.e., 263,315 children, 928,518 young adults, and 195,245 older adults, would develop COVID-19, resulting in 15,442 deaths. In contrast, if the double-dose strategy was taken instead, an estimated total of 1,900,172 persons, i.e., 377,107 children, 1,315,927 young adults, and 207,138 older adults, would develop COVID-19, yielding 17,423 deaths. Real-time investigation favored the disease transmission blocking option, i.e., single-dose vaccination strategy. Applying the single-dose-first strategy should yield a smaller epidemic size than applying the double-dose strategy; however, for both strategies, PHSM will be essential by the time second-dose COVID-19 vaccination is complete among all adults. © 2022 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

The partial immunity already offered by the first dose and the high levels of uncertainty in the vaccine supplies have been characteristic of most of the vaccination campaigns implemented worldwide and made the planning of such interventions extremely complex. Motivated by this compelling challenge, we propose a stochastic optimization framework for optimally scheduling a two-dose vaccination campaign in the presence of uncertain supplies, taking into account constraints on the interval between the two doses and on the capacity of the healthcare system. The proposed framework seeks to maximize the vaccination coverage, considering the different levels of immunization obtained with partial (one dose only) and complete vaccination (two doses). We cast the optimization problem as a convex second-order cone program, which can be efficiently solved through numerical techniques. We demonstrate the potential of our framework on a case study calibrated on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy. The proposed method shows good performance when unrolled in a sliding-horizon fashion, thereby offering a powerful tool to help public health authorities calibrate the vaccination campaign, pursuing a trade-off between efficacy and the risk associated with shortages in supply. © 2022 The Author(s)","Conic programming and interior point methods; Epidemics; OR in medicine; Uncertainty modeling; Vaccination","Economic and social effects; Optimization; Public administration; Public health; Uncertainty analysis; Vaccines; Conic programming; Conic programming and interior point method; Dynamic planning; Interior-point method; OR in medicine; Time interval; Uncertain supplies; Uncertainty; Uncertainty models; Vaccine supplies; Health risks","Elsevier B.V."

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998–2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October–november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate). © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Contact tracing; COVID-19; Deep learning; Government stringency index; Meteorological variables; Pandemic; PM2.5; Vaccination","Asia; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Arabian Peninsula; India; Iran; Philippines; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; South Korea; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; Meleagris gallopavo; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; COVID-19; disease transmission; epidemiology; health care; health policy; immunity; simulation; vaccination; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; Asia; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; environmental exposure; environmental factor; government; health care system; herd immunity; hospital bed capacity; human; India; intermittent lockdown; Iran; lockdown exit strategy; long term exposure; mortality rate; mortality risk; pandemic; Philippines; population movement pattern; public policy; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia; simulation; South Korea; Turkey (republic); United Arab Emirates; vaccination; virus transmission; weather; Asia; communicable disease control; policy; vaccination","Academic Press Inc."

As the pandemic evolves with no certainty of a herd immunity threshold, universal vaccination of at-risk populations is desirable. However, vaccine hesitancy threatens the return to normalcy, and healthcare workers (HCWs) must embrace their ambassadorial role of shoring up vaccine confidence. Unfortunately, voluntary vaccination has been suboptimal among HCWs in the United States, a priority group for whom immunization is essential for maintaining health system capacity and the safety of high-risk patients in their care. Consequently, some health systems have implemented mandates to improve compliance. Areas covered: This article discusses the ethical and practical considerations of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policies for HCWs utilizing some components of the World Health Organization’s framework and the unique context of a pandemic with evolving infection dynamics. Expert opinion: COVID-19 vaccine mandates for universal immunization of HCWs raise ethical and practical debates about their appropriateness, especially when the vaccines are pending full approval in most jurisdictions. Given the superiority of the vaccines to safety and testing protocols and their favorable safety profile, we encourage health systems to adopt vaccination mandates through participatory processes that address the concerns of stakeholders. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; health personnel; mandatory program; public health; vaccination","COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Health Personnel; Humans; Policy; Social Justice; United States; Vaccination; SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; health care personnel; health care policy; herd immunity threshold; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; immune response; immunogenicity; mandatory program; pandemic; risk assessment; social justice; United States; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy; virus load; administration and dosage; epidemiology; legislation and jurisprudence; policy; prevention and control; social justice","Taylor and Francis Ltd."

Mutations in the spike protein of the virus can impact the functional characteristics and effectiveness of vaccines. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze mutations in three key regions of the spike protein, investigate clinical presentations, and assess protective immune levels in healthcare workers (HCWs) who had received full vaccine doses but were re-infected. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 49 breakthrough-infected HCWs were included from November 2021 to May 2022. After confirming COVID-19 reinfection, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was extracted using the ROJE extraction kit, and genetic variation analysis was performed through Sanger sequencing. Blood samples were collected with prior consent, and ELISA tests were performed to determine antibody levels. Clinical presentations were recorded, and independent t-tests revealed no significant gender-based differences in the C-terminal point mutation. Additionally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no significant variance in this mutation concerning age or vaccine type. The analysis found no significant difference in clinical symptoms among vaccine types, including fever, chills, headache, and other clinical manifestations. Results: In this study, 75.5% (37/49) of the included HCWs were female (P-value < 0.05), and 25 were qualified for PCR and gene sequencing. Mutations were observed in 25, 10, and 1 sequence(s) of the C-terminal domain, N-terminal domain, and RBD regions of the S1 gene, respectively. The mutations had no significant correlation with the patient’s gender, age, or occupation, but they were significantly more prevalent in those with underlying diseases. 63.3% (31/49) of patients had high or very high IgG levels, and none had undetectable antibody levels at the time of reinfection. Loss of the sense of smell (69.4%-34/49), sore throat (65.3%-32/49), headache (59.2%-29/49), and cough (57.1%-28/49) were the most prevalent clinical manifestations (P > 0.05) in breakthrough-infected HCWs, aligning with the pattern of symptoms seen in the Omicron wave. However, the loss of the sense of taste showed significant results concerning clinical manifestation (P < 0.05). The examination of mutations revealed the presence of the Omicron variant in the majority of individuals. Point mutations in the C-terminal region did not significantly vary based on age, gender, or vaccine type. No significant difference was observed between vaccine types and clinical symptoms. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study identified spike protein mutations in reinfections among vaccinated healthcare workers. While mutations were prevalent, no significant correlations were found with demographics or vaccine types. Symptoms resembled the Omicron variant, notably with the loss of the sense of taste as a significant marker. Detectable antibody levels post-reinfection suggest that vaccine-induced immunity remains robust. Continuous monitoring of virus variants is crucial for optimizing vaccination strategies in the face of evolving strains. © 2024, Saeb et al.","COVID-19; Healthcare Personnel; SARS-CoV-2; Sequencing; Vaccination","adult; amino terminal sequence; antibody response; Article; blood sampling; breakthrough infection; carboxy terminal sequence; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene sequence; genetic variation; health care personnel; human; iron binding capacity; male; molecular cloning; observational study; pandemic; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; questionnaire; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sanger sequencing; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; virus detection; virus isolation; virus strain","Brieflands"

The extent of this change in knowledge and public perspective is difficult to measure in a populous nation like India subjected to individual freedom and cultural beliefs. Hence, we planned this study with the objective of evaluating the knowledge and perception of the Indian public towards COVID-19 disease, vaccination and research activities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: This is an observational, single-center, cross-sectional study (n = 244) conducted after obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee for Academic Research Projects. All consenting study participants, Indian residents aged > 18 years, were administered a prevalidated and structured questionnaire and interviewed for their honest opinion. The outcome measures were to evaluate the knowledge and perception of the study participants in each of the domains of COVID-19 disease, COVID-19 vaccination, and COVID-19-related clinical research. Demographic characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. All analyses were done at a 5% significance level using GraphPad InStat version 3.1. Data on the proportion of participants’ responses to the questions in each of the three domains of COVID-19 disease (D), COVID-19 vaccination (V), and COVID-19-related research (R) were assessed. Results: Study participants who knew the causative agent for coronavirus disease were 93.03% (227/244), nomenclature (77.45%, 189/244), those who could define pandemic (89.34%, 218/244), preventive measures against covid (96.31%, 235/244), lungs as the most common organ affected (96.31%, 235/244) and all answered that the origin of novel coronavirus was China. The majority of them felt that COVID-19 pandemic waves would never end (39.34%, 96/244), there was no effective drug/vaccine therapy available, and the lack of oxygen/hospital beds (39%) resulted in maximum mortality, and 47.13% (115/244) were worried about future bioterrorism.The lockdown measures were justified by 161/244 (65.98%), and 93.85% supported lockdown measures to curb the spread of infection. The improvement in air quality/environment hygiene, realizing the importance of hygiene, vaccine and disease, and spending quality time with family were the best three things to happen during the pandemic, while the loss of wages, nonavailability of medicines/vaccines/oxygen/hospital beds with mental/physical health deterioration were the worst three things experienced by people. Regarding COVID-19 vaccination, the most common reason to get vaccinated was to prevent infection/critical outcomes of COVID-19 (78.27%, 191/244); 79% already suffered COVID-19 prior to vaccination, while 68.85% suffered a COVID-19 infection after taking the vaccine which was mostly asymptomatic/mild. Almost 56.96% (139/244) participants supported compulsory vaccination for all in the larger interest of society and to prevent fatal COVID-19 outcomes. There were safety concerns mainly with accelerated approval of vaccines (4.1%, 10/244) among the public, and 32.78% (80/244) attributed limited infrastructure/vaccination centers/healthcare staff as the major challenge of a mass vaccination program with 71.72% (175/244) supporting the vehicle/home vaccination drives to meet the vaccination demand in the pandemic. Approximately 38.11% (93/244) blamed the lack of sufficient vaccine manufacturing sites in India as a major vaccine shortage. Almost 82% public knew that vaccines are incapable of providing lifelong immunity or conferring protection against multiple variants, with 34.83% desiring to get polyvalent vaccines that would provide immunity against multiple COVID-19 variants. A total of 57.37% knew about clinical research, believed that the vaccine/drug development process was slow in India (29.91%), that there was a lack of funds invested in COVID-19-related clinical research (62.29%), 47.95% felt no attention was given to the alternative system of medicines, 77.86% supported accelerated drug/vaccine approval in the pandemic. Around 64.34% of the study, participants knew about the available and approved COVID-19 treatment options, such as antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Of the total 244 study participants, 98.36% believed that clinical research is important for science to progress. When asked about their willingness to participate in COVID-19 clinical research, only 40.57% agreed, while 29% opted for non-COVID-19 related clinical research, and 29% refused to participate in any kind of clinical research. Almost 88.93% refused to take medicines without approval by drug regulatory bodies, and 54.51% agreed to participate in a controlled human challenge research study during the pandemic. The majority were of the opinion that lack of financial support (35.24%) was the main hindrance to the conduct of clinical research in India and the reason for lagging behind other countries in research and development (64.34%). Conclusion: The survey provides insight into the public awareness and perception of the pandemic that has taught all the lessons for capacity building in automation construction of robust medical infrastructure and the need for future preparedness. ©The Author(s).","","","Journal of Association of Physicians of India"

This paper provides a summary of Malta’s healthcare system journey during the COVID-19 pandemic with its initial preparedness for COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of COVID-19 on the service during the first 12 months of the pandemic. METHODS A literature search was conducted using Google and reviewing Maltese online newspapers. A comprehensive summary of internal operations conducted at Mater Dei Hospital, the country’s only acute general hospital, was provided by the Chief Operating Officer. RESULTS Several infrastructural changes including the increase in bed capacity and ITU areas were instituted in preparation for the pandemic. The health system showed resilience during the first wave. However, the situation was more precarious during the second wave. The end of December 2020 saw the start of the Covid-19 vaccination rollout, with over 30 health system hubs offering this service across the islands. Simultaneously health professional’s burnout is on the rise as resources and workforce are overstretched. CONCLUSION The collaborative effort between the guidance provided by the Public Health Authorities and the hospital’s multi-disciplinary team have been pinnacle during the pandemic. However, the future of the healthcare system is heavily dependent on the population’s behaviour, timely measures, the vaccination rollout and the type of immunity acquired through vaccination or infection. © 2022, University of Malta.

Although initial data did not demonstrate pregnancy as a more susceptible period to severe outcomes of acute severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are an increasing number of reports showing that not only pregnant women might be at significantly higher risk than non-pregnant women by COVID-19 but also the fetus. These findings may be related to adaptive changes that occur during pregnancy, such as the reduction in the residual respiratory capacity, the decrease in viral immune responses, and the increased risk for thromboembolic events. Additionally, despite the SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission evidence being uncommon, maternal illness severity might reflect serious perinatal and neonatal outcomes. Thus, protecting the maternal–fetal dyad against COVID-19 is critical. Even though pregnant women initially were excluded from vaccine trials, several studies have provided safety and efficacy of the overall vaccine COVID-19 platforms. Vaccination during pregnancy becomes a priority and can generate benefits for both the mother and newborn: maternal neutralizing antibodies are transmitted through the placenta and breastfeeding. Moreover, regarding passive immunization, human milk contains other bioactive molecules and cells able to modulate the newborn’s immune response, which can be amplified after the vaccine. Nonetheless, many issues remain to be elucidated, considering the magnitude of the protective immunity transferred, the duration of the induced immunity, and the optimal interval for pregnant immunization. In this review, we assessed these unmet topics supported by literature evidence regarding the vaccine’s immunogenicity, pregnancy immune heterogeneity, and the unique human milk antiviral features.

In order to understand the factors behind the slow vaccine uptake in Armenia, we aimed to explore the prevailing perceptions and experiences of healthcare providers and the general public related to COVID-19 vaccines. The study applied a convergent parallel mixed-methods study design (QUAL-quant) through in-depth interviews (IDI) and a telephone survey. We completed 34 IDIs with different physician and beneficiary groups and a telephone survey with 355 primary healthcare (PHC) providers. The IDIs found that physicians held variable views on the need for COVID-19 vaccination which, combined with mixed messaging in the media landscape, fueled the public’s vaccine hesitancy. The survey results were mostly consistent with the qualitative findings as 54% of physicians hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines were rushed without appropriate testing and 42% were concerned about the safety of those vaccines. Strategies to improve vaccination rates must target the main drivers of hesitancy, such as physicians’ poor knowledge of specific vaccines and spiraling misconceptions about them. Meanwhile, timely educational campaigns with targeted messaging for the general public should address misinformation, promote vaccine acceptance, and empower their capacity to make decisions about their health. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; healthcare provider; vaccine","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; adult; adverse outcome; anxiety; Article; attitude; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; drug safety; female; health care personnel; human; human experiment; infection control; innate immunity; male; middle aged; misinformation; perception; primary health care; semi structured interview; social distancing; thematic analysis; vaccination; vaccine hesitancy","MDPI"
