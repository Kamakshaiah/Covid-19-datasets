"text.127.content","流感是由流感病毒引起的一种急性呼吸道传染病，严重危害人群健康。流感病毒其抗原性易变，传播迅速，每年可引起季节性流行，在学校、托幼机构和养老院等人群聚集的场所易发生暴发疫情。每年季节性流感流行在全球可导致万万重症病例，万万呼吸道疾病相关死亡。孕妇、婴幼儿、老年人和慢性基础疾病患者等高危人群，患流感后出现严重疾病和死亡的风险较高。尤其是全球新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）疫情严重流行态势仍在持续，今年我国南方部分省份出现夏季流感流行高峰，今冬明春可能会出现新冠与流感等呼吸道传染病叠加流行的情况。接种流感疫苗是预防流感、减少流感相关重症和死亡的有效手段，可以减少流感相关疾病带来的健康危害及对医疗资源的挤兑。我国现已批准上市的流感疫苗有三价灭活流感疫苗（iiv）、四价灭活流感疫苗（iiv）和三价减毒活流感疫苗（laiv），iiv包括裂解疫苗和亚单位疫苗，iiv为裂解疫苗，laiv为减毒疫苗。流感疫苗在我国属于非免疫规划类疫苗，居民自愿接种。年以来，中国疾病预防控制中心每年印发当年度的《中国流感疫苗预防接种技术指南》。一年来，新的研究证据在国内外发表，为更好地指导我国流感预防控制和疫苗接种工作，国家免疫规划技术工作组流感疫苗工作组综合国内外最新研究进展，在年版指南的基础上进行了更新和修订，形成了《中国流感疫苗预防接种技术指南（—）》。本指南更新的内容主要包括以下几个方面：第一，增加了新的研究证据，尤其是我国的研究结果，包括流感疾病负担、疫苗效果、疫苗安全性监测、疫苗预防接种成本效果等；第二，更新了一年来国家出台的有关流感防控政策和措施；第三，更新了—年度国内批准上市及批签发的流感疫苗种类；第四，更新了本年度三价和四价流感疫苗组分；第五，更新了—年度的流感疫苗接种建议。本指南建议：原则上，接种单位应为≥月龄所有愿意接种流感疫苗且无接种禁忌的人提供接种服务。≥岁人群可在一次接受免疫服务时，在两侧肢体分别接种灭活流感疫苗和新冠疫苗；岁人群，建议流感疫苗与新冠疫苗接种间隔仍大于 d。对可接种不同类型或不同厂家疫苗产品的人群，可由受种者自愿选择接种任何一种流感疫苗，无优先推荐。结合今年新冠肺炎疫情形势，为尽可能降低流感的危害和对新冠疫情防控的影响，优先推荐以下重点和高风险人群及时接种：（）医务人员，包括临床救治人员、公共卫生人员、卫生检疫人员等；（）大型活动参加人员和保障人员；（）养老机构、长期护理机构、福利院等人群聚集场所脆弱人群及员工；（）重点场所人群，如托幼机构、中小学校的教师和学生，监所机构的在押人员及工作人员等；（）其他流感高风险人群，包括≥岁居家老年人、月龄岁儿童、慢性病患者、月龄婴儿的家庭成员和看护人员以及孕妇。对于iiv，月龄岁儿童首次接种流感疫苗的应接种剂次，间隔≥周；—年度或以前接种过剂次或以上流感疫苗的儿童，建议接种剂次；≥岁儿童和成人仅需接种剂次。对于laiv，无论是否接种过流感疫苗，仅接种剂次。建议各地在疫苗供应到位后尽早开展接种工作，尽量在当地流感流行季前完成接种。同一流行季，已按照接种程序完成全程接种的人员，无需再次接种。孕妇在孕期的任一阶段均可接种灭活流感疫苗。接种单位在整个流行季节都可以提供接种服务。本指南适用于疾控机构、医疗机构、妇幼保健机构和接种单位等从事流感防治相关的专业人员。根据国内外研究进展，本指南今后亦将定期更新、完善。
